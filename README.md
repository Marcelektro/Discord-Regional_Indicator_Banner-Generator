# Discord RegionalIndicator Banner Generator


A simple program allowing user to create cool-looking Discord messages made of RegionalIndicator emojis, making the text big!

The output text can be used as a welcome message or a read-only channel title such as self-roles etc.

This project is my first VCS, so I made it just for fun to test VCS! :D
